Git and GitHub, though often used together, serve different purposes. Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code, manage different versions, and collaborate on projects by using branches and merges. It operates locally, meaning developers can work on their code without needing internet access. On the other hand, GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking. GitHub enhances Git by allowing developers to share their code online, collaborate with others, and integrate with various tools for continuous integration and deployment. Essentially, Git manages the version history of your code, while GitHub helps you share and collaborate on that code with others.
